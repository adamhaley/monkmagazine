<br>
<br>
Lobster pounds and crazed Canadians out sunning in the frigid fog abounded up the winding coastal highway. Everyone spoke French. On second notice, it wasn't French at all. It was Mainers speaking in a loud guttural bellow, leaning on their horns, anxious to pass our brakeless, sputtering, white trash hippie camper with "I Brake For Dykes" emblazoned across the back bumper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
Pulling over to let the tailgating stream of traffic pass (one of the few Good Sam precepts we do abide by), Jim parked adjacent to a dock where a heated brawl between a lobsterman and a lobster was well into round three. Next to Joe's Lobster Pound stood a short squat hunk flailing a lobster against the side of a wall trying to knock it loose, his forearm caught in the crusher claw of a good-size five pounder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
The lobster's claw furiously clung to flesh, as Joe violently shook his arm. His shirt was ripped and his pants were hanging on his hips, offering a good view of Maine cleavage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
He was tripping over his untied boots, dropping change, keys and wallet on the ground, spit drooling down his plump red cheeks. And with a fierce look in his bulging eyes, he wailed at the desperate crustacean, who obviously did not want to meet his maker in the mighty hot cauldron.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
"Ayuh, the gawmy thing!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
Several out-of-towners stood back in horror, while a mother covered her son's eyes and ears, trying to pull her family back into their BMW. By now Joe's face was so red with rage he'd taken a brick, smashed the bloody creature, and in one last desperate attempt, plunged the defenseless lobster into the scalding cauldron, sealing its fate forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
"Ayuh, there she goes."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
Joe didn't feel a thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
No, not a thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The Monks cruised the hundred miles to Vegas under cloudy skies hoping to sneak in quietly before dawn. Coming over a hill, the orange, big-city glow slowly grew over the horizon. Finally, looking across a valley, Las Vegas literally popped into sight with a million watts of light arching across the desert floor like a march of fire ants spreading west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
With eyes smashed like grapes against the windshield The Monks exited down­town where they were momentarily bedazzled by the ten or so blocks of bright-as-­day casinos along dusty streets and broken pavement. Dolly Lama was at the window too, her pupils dilated to the point of pain from the high voltage light show popping off in a million directions at once. And then, just as quickly as it began, it stopped. The light and magic diminished to the point of nothingness. The adjacent neighborhood was as sad as any we'd ever seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
“That was it? I thought Vegas was more than that." Mike felt disappointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
"Do it again!" yelled Jim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
The Monks were content to circle the blocks a few more times with whiplashed necks bent low over the dashboard arching up to look at the lights, the signs and the buffet offerings. Finally, after more than six times around, Mike turned south on Las Vegas Boulevard and headed into the dark when all at once more lights popped into view, towering high and far away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
Further south the volume of light began to pick up again. It was like entering a new time zone of a forever-daylight neon world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
Passing Charleston Boulevard, The Monks now knew that compared to the paltry offering of glitz the downtown had so immediately surrendered, here, on The Strip, was the Mother Mary of neon glamour. Inflated, overstated, and completely bejeweled in its tackiest costumed splendor was the most white-trash-meets-bourgeois parody of America that had ever lit the skies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>
<br>
"Out of control, out of control," Mike was mumbling over and over as he inched down the Boulevard at six in the morning in a bizarre traffic jam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<br>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[EPISODE 8 ARKANSAS TEASER
<br>
<br>
Grandma Lane is known for far more than biscuits and gravy. As a matter of fact, she  doesn't do much cook'n . She's content to subsist on toast in the morning, grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch and supper, and an occasional meal of fish and cooked broccoli with melted cheese. She doesn't know what kind of fish it is. She just knows she likes it. You see, mundane things like food and its preparation don't much interest Grandma anymore. Though there is one thing that does still interest her. And, in fact, interests most everybody born in these parts. And that's "visit'n."
<br>
<br>
Visit'n is short for visiting, and it's a national pastime around here. Those of us who come from the city sneak our visits in short bites, usually on the phone, at some restaurant, maybe in the car en route to an event. Here in the Ozarks there's no such pressing agenda. The only thing you must do is go to work and make an occasional appearance at the local Church of Christ.
<br>
<br>
But visit'n? Now that's another matter. It's part and parcel of living in these hills. You can spot a local from a "northerner" by the degree of visit'n in which they engage. A northerner, mind you, is anybody who wasn't born in the Ozarks, even if they've lived here since they were three years old.
<br>
<br>
Northerners are easy to spot. They are usually looking at their watches or preoccupying themselves with other things besides visit'n. They'll invariably be in a hurry, talk fast, use your phone, pace the floor, light two cigarettes and leave early. They'll do anything to distract themselves from the undulating rhythms of visit'n.
<br>
<br>
What Northerners can't seem to get is that you've got to ease into visit'n. It's like entering a hot tub. You slide in like there is nothing else to do in the world. You've got to sloooooowwww down. Slow way down.
