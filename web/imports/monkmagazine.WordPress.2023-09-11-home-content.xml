<p style="text-align: left;">WELCOME TO MONK: THE MOBILE MAGAZINE.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Monk began in April 1986 when Mike, Jim, and their neurotic cat Nurse loaded up their worldly possessions, including sundry wool sweaters, into a rented U-Haul and fled San Francisco because they couldn’t afford the rent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They landed on John Deming’s back lawn in Paradise, California.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After being mistakenly hired as “gardeners” for two months, they earned enough scratch to purchase their first vehicle, the beloved “72 Ford Econoline van,” from which they began compiling a newsletter dubbed “The Monthly Monk.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their purpose was to stay in touch with friends and family while not looking like a couple of sleazy bums wandering through America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only three months into the journey, all hell broke loose, and they were up to their ears in “growing subscriber interest.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their “monthly” newsletter, already three months late, was wisely renamed Monk: The “Try-Quarterly.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would “try” to come out quarterly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As The Monks traveled throughout the Lower 48, Monk took on a power of its own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By March 1987, it went national, becoming the world’s first mobile magazine, supported by courageous advertisers and a devoted public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Monks set a new goal of searching the entire continent for their lost cat Nurse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Monk was written from the road about life on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In each issue, The Monks described their latest encounters with the lucky victims of their latest pitstop: everyone from artists to housewives, clowns to visionaries, and occasionally, even real live monks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were a gentle tickle in the side of the earnest seeker, the frazzled clerk, and the burned-out healer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They sought out the inner child, goofball, and prankster in all of us, though they could be quite informative, offering a uniquely personal yet keenly researched take on the land and its people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were also useful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thousands of readers used Monk to teach dogs how to fetch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the magazine was just the hard incarnation of a more expansive vision: The Monks’ living cells interacting with each other, the planet, and the sentient beings they met along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were a traveling show, publishing house, and monastery all rolled into one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only through Monk could you not only vicariously live through their escapades but join The Monks for the drive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And many did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, nearly 25 years since its last print issue, Monk has grown far beyond a rare and treasured heirloom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has entered mythic status as evidence of a pre-Internet America few today have experienced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As resident in-house philosopher Jim Monk recently opined, “Monk was pre-digital, fully human, non-AI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was imperfect, roughhewn, real.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You had to have it postal mailed to you or quickly grab it on a newsstand before it sold out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As today's billionaire CEOs sing the praises of their computer-engineered ‘content solutions,’ in truth, they’ve lost the connection to what is truly human and good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the mid-90s Faustian bargain that came with the Internet and the rise of a dehumanized, dopamine-driven techno-sphere, the hunger for a slower, kinder, pre-digital connection only grew apace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smartphones, smartwatches, game consoles, social media, and search engines are now so interwoven into our lives that we are, in effect, ‘bowling alone.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lots of sugar, no nutrition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Monk is the antidote to all that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still hunger for the authentic amateur and the real America, we invite you to, at long last, buy your untouched Monk back issues here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And please drop us a line to let us know who you are, where you are, and what’s been going on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fans and friends old and new . . . The Journey Continues.</p>

		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Before the worldwide web, smarty phones, GPS, Tik-tokery, and selfies, there was Monk––a singular, self-published print magazine, written, published, and distributed over twelve years entirely from the road.  Here are the basic facts, as we currently remember them. <br><br>


The Year: 1986.<br>
The Vehicle: a 1972 Ford Econoline Van.<br> 
The Founders: James Crotty, Michael Lane, and their cat Nurse.<br> 
The Tools: The first Apple Macintosh computer, piles of floppy disks, and an Olympus point-and-shoot camera.<br> 
The Project: Twelve solid years traversing North America <br> 
The Readers: millions of wannabe Monks and Monkettes living vicariously through the madcap adventures of their trusted compadres, The Monks.<br> 
The Motto: Simple, Mobile, True.<br> 
The Monikers: Kerou-wacky, Travel with a Twist, a magazine with a heart. <br> 
The Achievements: invented dashboard publishing, helped pioneer the mobile office and the zine, created blogging and van life before either were a thing. <br> <br> 

Accept no substitutes. Monk is the you you’ve been waiting for. Here’s how each issue of Monk began (with slight variations as we moved forward in space and time).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Buckle your seatbelts, put down your smartphones and pay attention to the off-ramps.  The Monks have a massive trove of wild, wacky, wonderful detours ahead.  Twelve solid years of mishaps started with our very first encounter along the roads of Northern California.  Landing in Paradise, California, before it burned, we found our way to the Abbey of New Clairvaux, a Trappist Monastery near Vina.  Days were spent at Deer Creek, watching the salmon slip through our fingers, while the hourly bells summoned a chance encounter with our first real Monk, Henry the Kindhearted.  You'll find many journeys of the heart, serendipitous encounters, and unexpected twists and turns in our search for the authentic soul of America. We promise never a dull moment.  Explore!]]></content:encoded>
